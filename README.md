## Keyboard lighting

This is a library that uses the [CUESDK](https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk) from corsair. You need to download the CUESDK in order to compile the project.

The code should work on every CUESDK compatible keyboard but is only tested on Corsair K70 keybaord. Every key index specific ReactiveEffect will only work on K70 (Mainly class RE_Key).

## Upcoming features

- Text file configuration
- More effects
- Layer system for effects
